# ML Algorithms Models

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of models that have been built using various algorithms implemented in the [ml-algorithms](https://github.com/msparsh/ml-algorithms) repository. The purpose of this repository is to provide a structured and organized way to showcase the application of these algorithms in real-world scenarios, enabling users to understand, utilize, and extend the models for their own projects.

## Contents
- **Datasets**: A collection of datasets used for training and testing the models. These datasets are either included in the repository or links to external sources are provided.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the usage of the models, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Getting Started
To get started with the models in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-algorithms-models.git
   cd ml-algorithms-models
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have the required dependencies installed.
   ```bash
   numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
   ```

3. **Run Notebooks**:
   Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to see practical examples of how to use the models. You can run the notebooks interactively to experiment with different configurations and datasets.
